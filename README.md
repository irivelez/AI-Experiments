The repo should contain at least four folders:

document: contains your final document in pdf format. Ideally, the document should pull figures and tables directly from the views folder.
scripts: contains all your scripts.
stores: contains all the data sets used. If files are "too big" for GitHub, include a document describing where people can access the data.
views: contains all figures and tables.
