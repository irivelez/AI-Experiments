# AI Experiments
 Baby steps with Open API

The repo should contain at least four folders:

- Scripts: contains all your scripts.
- Output: contains the outputs or results generated with AI
- Stores: contains all the data sets used. If files are "too big" for GitHub, include a document describing where people can access the data.
- Views: contains all figures and tables.
