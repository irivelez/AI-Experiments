    "txt = \"\"\"1/ The partnership between Stack Overflow and Google was officially announced, with the aim of using Stack Overflow's knowledge base to train its generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically its Large Language Models (LLMs). Until now, the skyrocket revenues generated by AI it was being created only from the technology side of AI developers and chipset enablers, neglecting part of those revenues to content creators and publishers. Through web-scrapping techniques, AI developers have been able to gather information from Stack Overflow, millions of books and websites without attracting much attention. However, this first known partnership highlights the need to compensate real human creators and communities for their contributions. Ultimately, the potential knowledge generated by AI is built upon the pre-existing knowledge created by humans.\n",
    "\n",
    "From an economic perspective, the introduction of charging AI developers for content usage in training LLMs creates a new and distinctive content market for exclusive players. This market is limited to those with the platforms and capabilities to provide the vast volume of data, information and knowledge needed to fuel AI systems effectively. At the dawn of a new technology, competition is primarily concentrated among the most capable participants that deliver tangible outcomes. While this may seem exclusionary, it is representative of how new establishments and status quos are established in the rapidly evolving tech industry. Thus, we are witnessing how the synergy and collaboration between AI-powered systems and human brain power for knowledge creation is being shaped and monetized.\n",
    "\n",
    "The collaboration between humans and AI has never been more exponential, scalable and profitable than it is now. While AI excels at detecting trends and patterns through metadata analysis, humans bring to the table invaluable expertise. As humans, we possess the ability to create new knowledge, problem solving skills, and creative thinking from our innate reasoning ability. This collaboration has the potential to boost creativity and productivity in the developer and technology industry, leveraging the strengths of both parties.\n",
    "\n",
    "The partnership between Stack Overflow and Google lays the foundation for future collaborations across industries, expanding possibilities in varios fields of knowledge. While this initial step is focused on developers world, the potential of these partnerships goes far beyond technological boundaries. By forging alliances and sharing resources, this approach can extend to disciplines such as social sciences, finance, healthcare, public policy, education and physics. To leverage AI-powered systems across multiple industries and fields, accurate and reliable data is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Public sector and governments hold vast sources of information that can be used to feed generative AI. Establishing public-private partnerships with institutions like the World Bank, OECD, NASA, CERN, and universities, can provide access to invaluable data stores to empower generative AI to produce insights for multiple industries and fields of knowledge. This cross-sector collaboration holds immense potential for innovative advancements and transformative discoveries that can shape the future of various domains and drive progress globally.\n",
    "\n",
    "The partnership between Stack Overflow and Google signifies the importance of the human factor as an enhanced mechanism for fine-tuning and ensuring trustworthiness in shaping the AI learning process. Furthermore, it highlights the vital role of knowledge communities as cornerstones in the evolution of generative AI and recognizes the economic significance of rewarding their valuable contributions through shared revenues. As we navigate the complexities of an increasingly AI-driven world, it is clear that recognizing and harnessing the collective wisdom of human expertise will be essential in realizing the full potential of these transformative technologies.\"\"\"\n",
